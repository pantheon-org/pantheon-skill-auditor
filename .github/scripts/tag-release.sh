# Pushes the tag vX.Y.Z for the crate version on the current commit when that tag
# does not exist yet. release-please only opens the release PR (it must not create
# the GitHub Release, because cargo-dist creates it in release.yml and fails if one
# already exists), so merging the release PR is what makes the version new here.
# The tag is created under the pantheon-ai-bot App token so the push fires release.yml.
# Run by .github/workflows/release-please.yml.
# Env: GH_TOKEN (App token), GH_REPO (owner/name), GITHUB_SHA (commit to tag)
